# 2-Player-Maze-Game
<h3>Description</h3>

A maze game which randomly generates a different maze each run through. Two players race from one end to the other to see who can make it there first.

<h3>Vision Statement</h3>

For our ISP project, we planned to create a maze game in which two players race from opposite ends of the maze to get to the other side as quickly as possible. Our vision for this project was to create a fully developed and functional game by the end of the project deadline, and have it ready to be played by other people. 

Team dynamics are an important part of our vision as we want to maximize collaboration and learning as the primary focus for this project. To achieve this goal, we will meet several times each week and be responsible for various tasks each with their individual implication and application to the success of the project. 

Our project is based on Python 3.12 and the Pygame library.
