The game consists of two players who play on one computer. The first player controls the first player's icon by using WASD keys to move its character and the second player controls the second player's icon by using the up, down, right, and left arrow keys. 
Players can change the colors of their characters and maze by accessing customization settings.
The maze can be reset, generating a new maze that is different from the previous maze. The scores will also be reset allowing players to start a fresh game.
Scores can be tracked and will increase when one player makes it to the other side.
