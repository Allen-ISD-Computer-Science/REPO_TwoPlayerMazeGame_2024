# Software Requirements Specification - Written by Madison Duch
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
The purpose of our game is to provide fun entertainment for two players, in an easy to understand game. The ability to customize the game also makes the game more interesting and appealing to users. The purpose of this document is to outline the goals and requirements that need to be met before the deadline to ensure we do not forget to include any features we want to implement.
<h3>1.2 Project Scope</h3>
Our goal is to have the game fully functional by the end of March/beginning of April, which gives us around 6 months to complete the project.
<h3>1.3 Intended Audience</h3>
The intended audience of our game is our classmates and possibly friends to help test its functionality. The intended audience of this document is just our team (Madison, Hannah, Rajveer, and Vidit) and Mrs. Jang to gain an understanding of our vision. 
<h2>2. Description</h2>
Our ISP will be a web-based game (name to be determined) that allows two (possibly more or less) users to compete in navigating a maze, with different levels that vary in difficulty. The colors of the maze itself, background, and the player icons will be customizable. 
<h3>2.1 User Needs / Functional Requirements</h3>
The game will allow two people to play on one computer by controlling the first player icon using the WASD keys to move, and the second player icon is controlled using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. They will both start in the middle and race to reach the outside, and whoever does so first will be the winner of that level and gain a point. Scores can be tracked and will increase when one player makes it to the outside. There will be various levels they can play to ensure the game doesn't get too boring or repetitive. The maze can be reset, generating a new maze that is different from the previous maze. The scores will also be reset allowing players to start a fresh game.
