# Software Requirements Specification - Written by Madison Duch
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
The purpose of our game is to provide fun entertainment for two players, in an easy to understand game. The ability to customize the game also makes the game more interesting and appealing to users. The purpose of this document is to outline the goals and requirements that need to be met before the deadline to ensure we do not forget to include any features we want to implement.
<h3>Project Scope</h3>
Our goal is to have the game fully functional by the end of March/beginning of April, which gives us around 6 months to complete the project.
<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
The intended audience of our game is our classmates and possibly friends to help test its functionality. The intended audience of this document is just our team (Madison, Hannah, Rajveer, and Vidit) and Mrs. Jang to gain an understanding of our vision. 
<h2>Description</h2>
Our ISP will be a web-based game (name to be determined) that allows two (or possibly more) users to compete in navigating a maze, with different levels that vary in difficulty. The colors of the maze itself, background, and the player icons will be customizable. 
<h3>User Needs / Functional Requirements</h3>
The game will allow two people to play on one computer by controlling the first player icon using the WASD keys to move, and the second player icon is controlled using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. They will both start on opposite ends of the maze and race to reach the middle, and whoever reaches the middle first will be the winner of that level. There will be various levels they can play to ensure the game doesn't get too boring or repetitive.
